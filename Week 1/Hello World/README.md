# Practice Programming Assignment: Hello, World

This project includes the following Java assignments:
> `HelloWorld`: A simple Java program that prints the message "Hello, World" to the console.

> `HelloGoodbye`: A Java program that takes two names as command-line arguments and prints hello and goodbye messages. The names provided as arguments will be used to construct the hello and goodbye messages, with the names in reverse order for the goodbye message.

> `RandomWord`: A Java program that reads a sequence of words from standard input and prints one of those words uniformly at random. The program uses Knuth's method, selecting each word with a probability of 1/i, where i represents the position of the word being read. The selected word is then considered the "champion." After reading all the words, the surviving champion (the word selected with the highest probability) is printed.
